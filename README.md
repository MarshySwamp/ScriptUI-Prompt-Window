# ScriptUI-Prompt-Window
A configurable ScriptUI replacement for the standard OS prompt(); dialog window for Adobe Photoshop. Created as a learning exercise more than anything, however, it may prove useful for those seeking a unified appearance from Mac to Windows OS. 

Created with the help of:

* https://scriptui.joonas.me/
* ScriptUI for Dummies by Peter Kahrel
* Adobe Photoshop User Forum and other fora related to scripting Adobe apps
